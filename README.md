# 🛒 Nonna App – Technical Test

**Project:** Fictitious e-commerce app for "Nonna" products  
**Technology:** Flutter (first-time use)  
**Time frame:** 3 hours (technical test)


## 📌 Description

This project was developed as part of a **technical challenge** with a 3-hour time limit. The goal was to create the basic structure of an e-commerce app using **Flutter**, a technology I had never used before. Despite the challenge, I quickly adapted by reading official documentation and references to deliver a modular and navigable base.


## ✅ What I was able to do

- Created a clear, modular project structure with folders for screens, models, and widgets.
- Implemented basic navigation between screens.
- Developed the following screens:
  - **Login**
  - **Register**
  - **Password Recovery**
  - Added a main menu with two buttons that are intended to navigate to other screens (currently non-functional).

## ⚠️ What I didn’t have time to complete or isn’t working

- The **Settings** screen exists but has no functionality.
- The **Profile** screen exists but is not operational.
- There is no main screen showing a **product list**.
- No functionality to **add products to the cart** or a **checkout screen**.
- No **data persistence** or backend connection implemented.
- Did not read the provided **JSON file** or connect to the given **endpoint**.


## 📝 Personal notes

I started by setting up a clean and scalable structure to build from. While I didn’t manage to implement all the required features in time, the project is ready to continue development.

I prioritized login, registration, and password recovery flows to create a solid base. Even though this was my **first time working with Flutter**, I'm proud of the progress I made in a limited time and excited to continue learning this new technology on my own.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Flutter** (Dart)  
- `flutter_hooks` (for functional state handling)  
- `flutter_hooks_riverpod` *(planned but not implemented)*  
- Documentation from [flutter.dev](https://docs.flutter.dev)

## 🙏 Thank you

Thank you for the opportunity to take on this technical test. It was a valuable experience that pushed me to learn fast, adapt, and build something functional with a new framework.
